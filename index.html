    <h2>Preface:</h2>
    <p>This is a collection of my work and collaborations. 
        I have chosen projects that I believe best displays my skills as a web designer,
        and I have hopefully presented them in a way that can demonstrate my progress as I learn and grow my trade over time.
        Some of this may be of interest to you. It can also be a resource to those willing to learn.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
                I am a (soon to be) full stack developer working to improve my skillset in a variety of modern languages.
            It is important that a web developer remains conscious of their everchanging surroundings, as programming, technology and society progress as a whole.
            And it is this awareness that I believe everyone is to benefit from. It is something that is stressed in a program through which I am earning a certification. 
            This motif is also ever-present in society as we intend to continue towards a better future for all.
            I wish to continue this path with the work I'll do for the remainder of my life, on whatever path I may find myself. <br>
                As an Arizona native, I can find a lot of solice in the fact that I will be able to continue a career online, as conditions get less and less hospitabile.
            All jokes aside, Arizona is losing its water supply more and more every year, and I'm not sure the engineers really have it all planned out as well as they say they do.
            I always grew up hoping and wishing that my work would one day let me be creative. Until I'm done with my certifcations, my day job is a painter. But I paint metal from a select set of colors,
            so that only allows me so much creativity. I've always worked in labor, outside, and the essence of that hard work does not escape me in my education. 
            I have always, and will always, be curious of what lies ahead. The skillset I've derived from working on the variety of projects that can be found here, has only fostered my curiousity more.
            As my abilities grow, so does my courage to take on new tasks. I hope to carry this courage and pride over into whatever work I find myself in.<br>
